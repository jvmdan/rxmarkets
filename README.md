## Scope

This is the **public** repository which exposes the RESTful API & underlying Java model. This is made available so that customers can integration the "rxmarkets" stack into their own software products.

A **private** repository also exists, which contains the proprietry analysis engine. This is a server-side environment not available for public consumption.

In due course, a valid API token will be required to access the product. A user or organisation need to buy a licence. During the product beta, a free trial option shall be made available.
