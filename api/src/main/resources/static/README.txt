__ cs-tweets.json __

A file containing 50 manually extracted tweets from Twitter on 22 March 2023.
The content within is simply the first 50 English tweets I was able to find
in the newsfeed with the hashtag #CreditSuisse. I did not make any attempt to
extract relevant data, and some of it appears to be no use at all. We will have
to devise a method of filtering said data from the stream when we automate this
process. In theory, given the current banking crisis, the data within should be
mostly negative. That means we expect to see a negative sentiment if we score this
dataset using an artificial intelligence.

A file containing 50 manually extracted tweets from Twitter on 22 March 2023.
The content within is simply the first 50 English tweets I was able to find
in the newsfeed with the hashtag #AAPL. I did not make any attempt to extract
relevant data, and some of it will be no use at all. In contrast to Credit
Suisse, there is no "Apple crisis" at the time of writing, so this should score
much higher in a sentiment test.

__ FINAL NOTE __

The timestamps might be wrong. I didn't bother to correct them. The tweets were
extracted on the 22nd and that is what I have used as the timestamp for now.
